## What is FastAPI?

FastAPI is a high-performant REST API framework for Python. It's built on top of 
[Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/) and it uses [Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/) 
for data validation. It can generate OpenAPI documentation from your code and also produces 
a Swagger UI that you can use to test your application.

Check out FastAPI's GitHub [repository](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi) and give it a 
star! Also make sure to check out its excellent [documentation](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) online.

## Additional resources

* The link to Swagger UI's [editor](https://editor.swagger.io/).

* REST APIs are documented with the OpenAPI documentation standard. You can learn more 
about OpenAPI in its official [website](https://www.openapis.org/).

* During the video, I make a reference to OpenAPI links. You can learn more about this 
concept from this segment from my 2021 EuroPython [conference](https://youtu.be/prGzBqUAXi4?t=1213).

* Check out my 2021 EuroPython [presentation](https://youtu.be/prGzBqUAXi4) to learn more about API testing.
